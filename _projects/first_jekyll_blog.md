- I want to try a new way to blogging without the overhead of any kind of non-essential stuffs like wordpress, custom domain and hosting management, monthly bills and etc. I want to focus on content creation as much as possible with minimal management system. 
- Here comes Jekyll, a static site generator and content management system written in ruby. By using jekyll I can write posts using markdown language and manage all the website with such an ease.
- Jekyll is a awesome for those people who wants to a blog with minimal look and little no management.
- I choose github pages for two reasons. One is its free and it's easy to integrate with jekyll. Everything is managed in a github repo. I don't want to bear any kind of overhead.
