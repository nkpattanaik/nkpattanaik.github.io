    <h2>Introduction: About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm a computer science student. I try to explore and learn every part of the computer stack. Computer stack refers to the very basic FPGA level programming to the most abstracted programming like UI proramming etc. I try to learn everything about the computing including core cs fundamentals and very advanced os programming.</p>
    <p>This is much like a journey for me. I'm not a advanced programmer in this stage. But my goal is to learn every part of the computer stack. And every day I try to learn and upskill myself a little bit everytime.</p>
